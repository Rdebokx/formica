Formica
=======
Formica is an Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm that allows you to load and model your data to so called DataPoints which will then be sorted by an Artificial Intelligence algorithm, 
based on the Ant Colony Optimization principle. Right now this project is still in an early stage where it is rather a proof of concept that allows you to sort simple DataPoints using
relatively simple Distance Metrics like the Euclidean Distance and Manhattan Distance metric. This should, however, provide you with a backbone for an Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm that is
easy to extend and reuse for any purpose you see fit.

This project is actively maintained and further developed. 
For more information on how to contribute to this project or currently planned development efforts, please see [the contribution instructions](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Getting started
The Formica module is still to be published to a central repository. Until then one can install the module locally using `mvn install`

Once you loaded Formica into your project, you can load DataPoints into a Colony, provide it with a configuration that suits your needs and start sorting!
For examples of how to use and run Formica, please see the [example package](src/main/java/com/rdebokx/formica/example).
